# Simple CRUD application (React + Firebase)

This is a CRUD application that was made by me in the Web Development discipline, during my graduation in Software Engineering (Federal University of Cear√°).

The `fron-tend` is made with React.js. And the `back-end` with Firebase (Firestore).

## Running the Application

**Step 1 - Cloning the repository:** Before anything, you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed. After that, clone the project to your computer, for do that, first you shoud enter in a folder that you want the application execute, in that, run the followin code: 

`git clone https://github.com/robertsonasc/simple-crud-react.git`

**Step 2 - Infact running the Application:** In the folder application (crud-professors-students) run: 

`npm start`

**Step 3 - Using the CRUD:** Enter in http://localhost:3000/ and be happy :smiley:

**OBS:** I am submitting Firebase API Key, with expiry date set to 3/11/2023.
